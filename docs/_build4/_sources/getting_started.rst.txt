**1. Installation**

``pip install snowmobile``

**2. Save a snowmobile.toml file**

.. tabbed:: Download

    .. only:: builder_html

       Download :download:`this <../snowmobile/core/pkg_data/snowmobile_TEMPLATE.toml>` file and
       remove the `_TEMPLATE` portion of the file name so that it's saved as **snowmobile.toml**.

.. tabbed:: Copy File Contents

    Copy the contents below in a file called **snowmobile.toml** anywhere on your local file
    system.

    .. literalinclude:: ../snowmobile/core/pkg_data/snowmobile_TEMPLATE.toml
        :language: toml
        :lineno-start: 1

**3. Store A Set Credentials**

The first few lines of **snowmobile.toml** are outlined below; **for minimum configuration**:
       1. Specify a valid set of credentials within the **[connection.credentials.creds1]** block
       2. Modify or remove any unwanted arguments within the **[connection.default-arguments]** block

.. literalinclude:: ../snowmobile/core/pkg_data/snowmobile_TEMPLATE.toml
   :language: toml
   :lineno-start: 2
   :lines: 2-26
   :emphasize-lines: 4, 13, 22

.. Tip::
       For initial setup and to ensure replicability of code samples, it's a good idea to:
              1.     Leave *default-creds* as is
              2.     Leave the **aliases** for *creds1* and *creds2* as *creds1* and *creds2*
              3.     Store a second set of credentials under *creds2* if available; if not, store the same set as used
                     for *creds1* under the alias *creds2* as well


**4.** Connect to :xref:`snowflake`

.. code-block:: python

    import snowmobile

    sn = snowmobile.Connector()

Successful setup and connection results in ending console output similar to:.
